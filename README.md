👋 Hi, I’m @MrYinsen  
  
**🤷‍♂️ What am I doing and why?**:  
I believe math, physics, and computer science provide a comprehensive ruleset for the inhabitable worlds that we currently know of (physical and digital). Physics provides rules for the physical world, computer science provides rules for the digital world, and math is the lens through which we have the capacity to understand, compress, and interact with these rulesets.  
I'm currently in the midst of a two year journey to develop a deep maturity in math and physics. During my early course of study, I've grown increasingly curious about the growing potential of computational physics as a tool for low cost, high speed experimentation in the digital universe, as a general predictor of physical systems, and more plainly as an application based form of learning to concretize the things I learn. As a result, I've chosen to learn C++ for the purposes of exploring the computational physics portion of this endeavor.  
  
**👀 What will you find on this github?**:  
This github will include sets of educational and scientific coding projects that are relevant to the topics I'm learning. The topics will range from C++ basics, implementation of algorithms in linear algebra and calculus, computer graphics, and physics simulations ranging from introductory to highly complex topics.
