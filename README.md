👋 Hi, I’m @MrYinsen  
  
**🤷‍♂️ What am I doing and why?**:  
I believe math, physics, and computer science provide a comprehensive ruleset for the inhabitable worlds that we currently know of (physical and digital). Physics provides rules for the physical worlds, computer science provides rules for the digital world, and math is the lens through which we have the capacity to understand, compress, and interact with these rulesets.  
Eight months ago, April of 2023, I began a two year journey to develop a deep maturity in math  and four months ago, August of 2023, I added the exploration of foundational physics (classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum physics, statistical mechanics, fluid dynamics, and solid state physics). During my early course of study, I've grown increasingly curious about the growing potential of computational physics as a tool for low cost, high speed experimentation in the digital universe, as a general predictor of physical systems, and more plainly as an application based form of learning to concretize the things I learn. As a result, I've chosen to learn C++ for the purposes of exploring the computational physics portion of this endeavor.  
  
**👀 What will you find on this github?**:  
This github will include different sets of scientific coding projects that are relevant to this things I'm learning. Early on contributions will generally be with respect to my learning C++. After which I'll begin working through sets of mathematical operations that I've learned to develop maturity in scientific computing before beginning computational physics portion of coding. For example, at early stages in my studies, one may find basic implementations of linear algebra operations such as Gauss-Jordan elimination, Gram-Schmidt, or SVD. As I get better at mathematical operations I'll begin to transition into physics simulations starting with simple kinematics,  introductory linear mechanics, and introductory angular mechanics that one would encounter in a first classical mechanics course. As my studies and programming skills develop together, the expected complexity of simulation types will evolve towards more advanced topics such as quantum or statistical mechanic modeling.
